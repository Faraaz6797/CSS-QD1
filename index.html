    <!-- Difference between flex row and column -->
    The Difference between Flex row and Flex Column is tht by using Flex-direction:row we can align the items in horizontal direction
    by using flex-column we can align the items in vertical direction

    Note: The Flex-direction Property must be specify in parent Div

    <!-- Explain inline , internal and external stylesheet -->
    Inline CSS: Requires the style attribute placed inside an HTML element. 
    <!-- Internal CSS: Requires the <style> element placed inside the head section of an HTML file.  -->
    /* External CSS: Requires the <link> element placed inside the head section of an hTML file */

    <!-- Justify-content allows you to do what? -->
    The CSS justify-content property defines how the browser distributes space between and around content items along the main-axis 
    of a flex container and the inline axis of a grid container.

    <!-- Difference between absolute and relative positioning -->
    position: relative places an element relative to its current position without changing the layout around it,
     whereas position: absolute places an element relative to its parent's position and changing the layout around it.

     <!-- What is grid-template-columns used for? -->
     The grid-template-columns property specifies the number (and the widths) of columns in a grid layout.
      The values are a space separated list, where each value specifies the size of the respective column.

      <!-- What is the z-index in CSS? -->
      The z-index property specifies the stack order of an element. 
      An element with greater stack order is always in front of an element with a lower stack order.
  

      <!-- What is the difference between padding and margin? -->
      Padding
      
      Padding is a CSS property that defines the space between an element content and its border (if it has a border).

      Margin
      Margin is a CSS property that defines the space of outside of an element to its next outside element.

      The difference between margin and padding is that while padding deals with the inner space, margin deals with the outer space to the next outer element.
      Note : If an element does not have a border around it, then adding padding has no effect at all on that element, because there is no border to give space from.
      If an element does not have a border, then margin defines the space from the element content to the next outer element.
